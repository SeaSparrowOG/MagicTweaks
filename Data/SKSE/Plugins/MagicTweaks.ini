;New in 2.2.0 - Fixes the cloak archetype. In vanilla, the magnitude of the effects cloaks apply to their
;targets would be modified if the caster is dual casting, regardless of whether or not the effect itself
;was dual cast. So -> Cast fire cloak, deal 8 damage per second. Start dual casting any spell, and you deal 
;18 damage per second until you stop dual casting. This only seems to affect Value Modifier effects.

;Added in 1.1.0
;Earn a small amount of Conjuration EXP when you hit someone with bound weapons, or your
;Conjured or Reanimated minions hit a target.

;Added in 1.2.0
;These represent a new way of reducing spell costs. The new formula for spell cost reduction is:
;1 / (1 + fCostReductionSkillWeight * AV), reduced up to (1 - fMaxSpellCostReduction) * Original Spell Cost.
;In short, this is a much better system for spell reduction when paired with the optional plugin in the page
;and Parapet's excellent Crafting Skills Revamped: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25418

;This is not recommended for Simonrim/Requiem.
;If you are going to be editing fCostReductionSkillWeight, be aware that skills can go into the negatives,
;so if you make the denominator 0, you WILL crash. EG, for fCostReductionSkillWeight = 0.01:
; 0.01 * -100 = -1 => Denominator == 0, therefore crash.

;as the parameter. Depending on the parameter, the condition will return a different number.
;MGT_PRXY_CommandedConjurationCount -> Total count of Summoned and Reanimated minions.
;MGT_PRXY_CommandedConjurationSummon -> Total count of Summoned minions.
;MGT_PRXY_CommandedConjurationReanimated -> Total count of Reanimated minions.

;Adds in a new Actor Value called "MagickaShield". Magicka Shield is an actor value that ranges from
;0 to 100, and mitigates a percentage of incoming damage from Health to Magicka.
;EG: 50 MagickaShield -> 50% of incoming damage is first dealt to your Magicka (excess is dealt to Health).
